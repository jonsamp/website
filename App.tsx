          ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm a software developer at{" "}
          <Link href="https://expo.io">Expo</Link> in New York City, where I
          work on mostly frontend projects. I love making quality user
          experiences with JavaScript, React Native, and Expo. You can find me
          on <Link href="https://github.com/jonsamp">GitHub</Link>,{" "}

          a list of my side-projects and packages below. Thanks for stopping by!{" "}

            Originally from Kansas, I started post-college life as a herpetology
            researcher (

              I have a wild story where I had ~100 snakes in my car at once. Ask
              me!
            </Em>
            ). At the same time, I was interested in higher education. I found a
            job as an admissions counselor, and proceeded to spend a year
            driving hundreds of miles around rural Kansas while talking to high
            schoolers and their parents about education.{" "}

            Then I moved to Chicago, taught myself Ruby on Rails, and was
            incredibly lucky to find a job as a developer. The problem was the
            job was writing JavaScript. They took a chance on me and I studied
            JavaScript every day on the train. I eventually wrote a{" "}
            <Link href="https://www.codecadEmy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript">
              course on JavaScript

            Finally, I moved to New York City. While I <Em>hated</Em> it at
            first, now I love it more than I can say. I have a sassy dog named
            Nikko (she has a{" "}

              must-see Instagram

            coder-dude stereotype), and cook everything I see on{" "}
