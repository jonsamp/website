          ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm a software developer at{" "}
          <Link href='https://expo.io'>Expo</Link> in New York City, where I
          work on frontend and design projects. I love making quality user
          experiences with JavaScript, React Native, and Expo. You can find me
          on <Link href='https://github.com/jonsamp'>GitHub</Link>,{" "}

            Originally from Kansas, I started post-college life as a herpetology
            researcher (

              I have a wild story where I had ~100 snakes in my car at once. Ask
              me!
            </Em>
            ). At the same time, I was interested in higher education. I found a
            job as an admissions counselor and proceeded to spend a year driving
            hundreds of miles around rural Kansas while talking to high
            schoolers and their parents about education.{" "}

            Then I moved to Chicago, taught myself Ruby on Rails, and was
            incredibly lucky to find a job as a developer... as a JavaScript
            developer. While I didn't know JavaScript, they took a chance on me
            and I studied JavaScript every day on the train. I eventually wrote
            a whole{" "}
